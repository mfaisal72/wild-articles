        Monkeys are intelligent animals that are
        good at solving problems. Almost all types live together in groups. A monkey group commonly includes several
        related females, their young, and one or more males. Monkeys use facial expressions, body movements, and various            noises to communicate with each other.</p>

        animals. They are found mostly in dense forests and are always found in groups. The elephants are black in
        colour with a small tail, two big ears, thick legs, a trunk, and two little eyes. The teeth of elephants are
